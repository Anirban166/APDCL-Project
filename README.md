# APDCL-Project

Tools: 
-------
PHPMyAdmin | MySQL | Apache Server

Objectives:
-------
(1) Data Storage for attributes such as Username/Password/Email/DOB/DOR divided into two concurrent tables with masking of both.

(2) Apart from regular users, an Administrator with greater rights should be accountable for supervision.

(3) Collect daily logs for each user which are accessible by them individually, with the Admin having privileged access to all.

(4) Generate report / save logs into a pdf file. (with timestamp and necessary details)

(5) Create session and disable multiple cases of a running session. (Switch to new session if concurrency exists)

(6) Password Encryption (one liners such as Md5 should be avoided, use RSA from repository).

(7) Use One Time Password (OTP) verification for forgotten password case, with OTP being sent to email.
